## Syntax
```
browser.py
```

## Stages
**Stage #1 Address line**  
Let's create the first capability for our browser! It has to read the URL and show the user a "hard-coded" website with some news.

**Stage #2 Tabs**  
Time to add some user-friendliness. The program should store our pages as files and show them if the user enters a shortened request. Watch for inappropriate input, though!

**Stage #3 Hotkeys**  
Sometimes you want to revisit the past. Let's add a “back” button by using the stack.

**Stage #4 Requesting**  
Time to play in a new way. Now only real web pages! Get to know the Request library.

**Stage #5 Parsing**  
Let’s enhance the readability of our pages and teach our browser to output only a certain text from HTML tags.

**Stage #6 Formatted output**  
Look-and-feel is important to the browser experience. Let's read about a new library, experiment a bit, and highlight our links in blue.
